Conducted an audit to determine which ports needed to be open and secured the non essential ports using UFW.The entire process went pretty smoothly, until I came to the Unify Controller software. This one I needed to hit the books and discovered that it needed 10+ ports opened to allow the system to fully function.Did a little more research and learned that I could lock those ports down to internal network traffic only. This is obviouysly not the best method, but it is alot better than I had implemented previously with everything wide open." }, { "title": "TrueNAS Scale", "url": "/smillang.github.io/posts/post-nine/", "categories": "Homelab, Hardware", "tags": "TrueNAS", "date": "2022-11-04 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "TrueNASScale, today I worked on properly setting up Rsync on my servers.I currently have three (3) TrueNAS Scale servers setup; I have one setup to server Media, another setup to store my computer backups and finally one setup to act as a share network wide." }, { "title": "Wireguard", "url": "/smillang.github.io/posts/post-eight/", "categories": "Homelab, Software", "tags": "Wireguard", "date": "2022-10-28 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "WireguardToday, I setup Wireguard for the first time, and after a little bit of tweeking.
