# Security

update, on all of my homelab virtual machines.  Conducted an audit to determine which ports needed to be open and secured the non essential ports using UFW.

The entire process went pretty smoothly, until I came to the Unify Controller software.  This one I needed to hit the books and discovered that it needed 10+ ports opened to allow the system to fully function.

Did a little more research and learned that I could lock those ports down to internal network traffic only.  This is obviouysly not the best method, but it is alot better than I had implemented previously with everything wide open.
