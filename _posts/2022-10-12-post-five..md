# DokuWiki

Today I worked on setting up a DokuWiki site to store my configuration information related to the HomeLab.  I started with a VM, but ended up starting over and putting it into a LXC container.  This reduced the resources needed to run the site and since I am the only user speed was not my main concern, I wanted reliability.
