# Wireguard

Today, I setup Wireguard for the first time, and after a little bit of tweeking.  I now have 3 devices setup to connect directly to my homelab.  As a result I have closed nearly all my external ports in my firewall, and those ports which are open are protected by a reverse proxy server.

I think I will work on OpenVPN tomorrow, and get it setup as an alternative to Wireguard.
