# Update

and progress report.  My home lab now consists of 3 servers and 1 network attached storage appliance.  My hyper visor of choice is Proxmox, and I am also using TrueNAS Scale for my network attached storage.  I've built all my Virtual Machines utilizing Ubuntu Server 22.04, with one exception I use Pop-OS 22.04 on my Workstation with a GUI.  I am running 20 docker containers, using Portainer at its base.
